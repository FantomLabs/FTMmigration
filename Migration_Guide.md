Many Fantom users still hold legacy FTM tokens across various networks, including Opera, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. While these tokens were essential to Fantom’s early development, the launch of the Sonic network represents **a significant technological leap** - making the old FTM tokens obsolete.

As the ecosystem transitions, it’s **important to migrate** your FTM to Sonic, as legacy tokens will gradually **lose support** across dApps and exchanges and eventually become unusable. The Sonic network and the new S tokens will remain active moving forward.

_This is a 1:1 ratio migration, meaning that anyone who migrate Fantom (FTM) tokens will receive an equal amount of Sonic (S) tokens_

**How to Migrate?**

Any remaining Fantom (FTM) tokens must be migrated using **the migration smart contract**. This contract is purpose-built for migration and allows you to transfer your tokens **directly**, without relying on third-party platforms. This makes the process both secure and straightforward. The migration contract is **open-source**, meaning its code is publicly available and verifiable by anyone.

Users are required to pay **a gas fee** when sending tokens to the contract. The fee amount depends on current network conditions and the blockchain where the FTM tokens are held.

You can use **any wallet** that supports FTM to initiate the migration. The process is identical across all wallets and does not require any special configuration.


**Steps to Start Migration Process**

1. **Access Your Wallet:** Open your wallet and check your FTM balance under the list of assets

2. **Send Tokens:** Send your FTM tokens to the migration smart contract address: ```0x54Ef1646120fE832FC03Cfa2c7C87a4284e6871A```. Make sure to send your entire FTM balance. The migration contract will wait for the full balance to arrive before initiating the migration process to optimize gas fees

3. **Confirmation:** Once your transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration will begin. Your wallet will then be credited with the new Sonic (S) tokens. Please allow 30–60 minutes for the migration to complete
   

**Post-Migration**

Once the migration is complete, the user’s wallet will **automatically recognize** the new Sonic network, and S tokens will be credited directly to the same wallet. The new tokens remain tied to **the same private key and seed phrase**. This ensures the migration contract knows exactly where to deliver the newly migrated tokens.

After migration, S tokens can be used across supported dApps or traded on any exchange that previously listed Fantom, as these platforms now support the Sonic network.

**LP Positions**

If you hold liquidity positions, you'll need to:

Withdraw existing LP positions on Fantom

Migrate each token individually by following the previously specified steps

Recreate your positions on Sonic
